    <h1 class="title"> THE ORIGIN BEHIND CORDOVA'S NAME & BRGY</h1>
    <p><i>
      
CORDOVA wasn't its original name, nor the Spanish "CORDOVA." It covers the original barrios of Gabi, Day-as, and Pilipog in the southern tip of Mactan Island. These became Cordova in 1863.

Cordova became a town in 1864, and 15 mayors governed since 1913. Before being Governor General, Rafael Echag√ºe y Bermingham, in 1858, was in the Spanish Congress. He likely named it "CORDOBA" after his experiences in Spain, meaning "stark nakedness."

Apart from Spain and the Philippines, cities named Cordoba or Cordova exist in Argentina, Colombia, USA, and Mexico, named by Spanish in memory of Spanish Cordoba.
<br><br>

IBABAO means upper, separated from Lapu-Lapu City by Pilipog river northwestward. <br><br>

BANG-BANG originated from Mariano Sumagang's strength. After a typhoon, he lifted a fallen tree, and people exclaimed, "DILI MA BANGBANG ANG KAKUSGON NIANANG TAWHANA."<br><br>

BUAGSONG is known for Ayong and bakasi eel, Cordova's aphrodisiac.<br><br>

CATARMAN was Catarman, meaning "traumatizing presence" due to its salty water. Strangers said, "katagman man sab ning dapita" (this place is traumatizing).<br><br>

Except for Ibabao (1913), CATARMAN (1922), BUAGSONG, and BANG-BANG (1930s), other barangays were created post-war: COGON, DAPITAN, SAN MIGUEL, ALEGRIA, and GILUTONGAN.<br><br>

DAPITAN was Kalanggaman in Pilipog, enticing people to live there.<br><br>

SAN MIGUEL, once a Pilipog sitio, was named after its patron saint, St. Michael, upon Pilipog's conversion.<br><br>

Alegria comes from the Spanish "Alegre," meaning merriment.<br><br>

GILUTONGAN, the only islet barangay, became one in the 1940s. It got its name from "hilot" (massage) after fishermen's long hours of fishing.
